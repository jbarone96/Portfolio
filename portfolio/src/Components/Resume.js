          - Designed how a Connect Four game board displayed on the page with
          the use of CSS properties to allow the board to look just like it
          would in the real game. <br />- Effectively dealt with the possibility
          of edge cases to prevent inaccuracy in the game board when displaying
          the winning combinations and created an ideal way to determine the
          winning combinations for the game using JavaScript functions. <br />-
          Properly debugged and maneuvered around problems in code that would
          cause blocks of code not to run in the correct fashion.

          - Developed an online store allowing users to fully interact with the

          including entering billing and shipping addresses, credit-card
          information and filling out an order form. <br />- Properly coded the
          process of order submission that sends the order data to be stored in
